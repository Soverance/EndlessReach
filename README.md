This branch contains the source code for the final version of Endless Reach, built by Soverance Studios. The last version update was 2.4.1, in November of 2014. This application was built in Unity 4 and programmed in C#, and as it will never again be updated, the project is now entirely open source.

Endless Reach is a hardcore shoot â€˜em up that puts you in the shoes of a lone space drone pilot, laying claim to the uncharted galaxy known as the Reach.

Send your starfighter drone out into the unknown, and use it to battle your way through the alien hordes and make the regions safe for colonization. The future of humanity depends on you!
