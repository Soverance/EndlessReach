This branch contains the source code for the final version of Endless Reach, built by Soverance Studios. The last version update was 2.4.1, in November of 2014. This application was built in Unity 4 and programmed in C#, and as it will never again be updated, the project is now entirely open source.

Endless Reach is a hardcore shoot â€˜em up that puts you in the shoes of a lone space drone pilot, laying claim to the uncharted galaxy known as the Reach.

Send your starfighter drone out into the unknown, and use it to battle your way through the alien hordes and make the regions safe for colonization. The future of humanity depends on you!

Endless Reach was originally prototyped for mobile devices, and released for Android and Windows Phone devices. Oculus Rift support was added shortly afterward, and the VR supported version was released to Oculus Share. We also ran promotional campaigns for Endless Reach on both Steam Greenlight and the Square Enix Collective, though both were ultimately unsuccessful. The Greenlight page has since been removed, but the remaining informative links persist:

Endless Reach contains some basic shoot 'em up logic with the addition of a few new things, namely the Overload and Boost features. Online leaderboards are also incorporated, and they are powered a public Google Spreadsheet. There's saving and loading, as well as a "world hub" called the Nautilus that essentially serves as a fancy level select menu.
